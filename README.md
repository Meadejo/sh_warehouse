**A modular, production-ready data integration solution for homeless services and domestic violence programs**

## Overview
Many organizations serving people experiencing homelessness or fleeing domestic violence struggle with fragmented data across multiple systems. Manual data entry, inconsistent formats, and limited reporting capacity create administrative burden while compromising data quality and compliance reporting.
<p>
This project provides a complete PowerShell-based data warehouse pipeline designed specifically for HUD Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) compliance. It transforms disparate data sources into a single source of truth, automates routine data flows, and enables accurate reporting while reducing manual work.
<p>
Built for real-world use at a mid-sized non-profit, this pipeline is designed to be maintained by staff with varying technical backgrounds. The modular architecture allows organizations to implement the entire solution or adapt individual stages to their specific needs.

## Key Features
- HUD/HMIS Compliance by Design - Data structures align with HUD HMIS Data Standards
- Modular Stage-Based Architecture - 10 independent stages from discovery through reporting
- Production-Ready from Day One - Built to deploy incrementally while development continues
- Maintainable by Non-Specialists - Legible, well-documented code prioritizing clarity
- Multiple Data Source Support - Handles inconsistent formats and quality across systems
- Automated Data Quality Checks - Built-in validation and DQ reporting
- Flexible Output Options - Supports both technical data exports and non-technical reports

## Architecture Overview
The pipeline consists of 10 stages, each operating independently with consistent patterns:

- 00 - Orchestration: Flow control and pipeline coordination
- 10 - Discovery: Data source identification and cataloging
- 20 - Transformation: Data import and normalization
- 30 - Processing: Object creation and basic validation
- 40 - Post-Processing: Business rules and relationship mapping
- 50 - Warehousing: Long-term storage and source of truth creation
- 60 - Data Quality: Validation and DQ reporting
- 70 - Outputs: System-ready data exports
- 80 - Automation: Scheduled job management
- 90 - Reporting: Human-readable reports and dashboards

Each stage contains a control script (X0-StageName.ps1) and sub-stage scripts (X1, X2, etc.) for specific operations.

## Prerequisites
- Windows Server environment
- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- SQL Server (version TBD)
- Appropriate permissions for scheduled task execution

## Quick Start (WIP)
1. Clone the repository
2. Set your configuration options (examples provided)
3. Run individual stages to test your environment
4. Configure orchestration for automated execution

Detailed setup documentation coming soon.

## Important Notes
⚠️ **Data Security**: This repository contains only code and configuration templates. Never commit actual client data, connection strings, or sensitive configuration details.
<br>
⚠️ **HMIS Compliance**: While this pipeline aligns with HUD HMIS Data Standards, organizations must ensure their implementation meets all applicable compliance requirements for their jurisdiction and funding sources.
<br>
⚠️ **Production Use**: This software is provided as-is. Organizations should thoroughly test all stages in a non-production environment before deploying to production systems.
